* models.OccurrenceSeriesFactory takes rrule as parameter instead of rrule_kwargs. If you are going to migrate your application it should be enough to replace in OccurrenceSeriesFactory constructor call with ComplexRruleField:
<pre>
<code>
OccurrenceSeriesFactory(rrule_kwargs={'kwarg1': value1, 'kwarg2': value2... })

# replace with:

from django_timetable.fields import ComplexRruleField

OccurrenceSeriesFactory(rrule=ComplexRruleField(kwarg1=value1, kwarg2=value2...)
</code>
</pre>

* fields.RruleField was renamed to fields.ComplexRruleField

* fields.RruleField is a new class which can represent simple time intervals
