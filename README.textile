h1. django_timetable

h2. OVERVIEW

“What does this application do?”

* It implements recurring occurrences series (for example: create series of 'event' which occurres every monday for next two months).
* It uses abstract models factories (http://gist.github.com/584106) so you can easly subclass given models without any overhead or generic relations

.. what doesn't?

It doesn't implement any ,,Event'' class or ,,Calendar'' class  - it's up to you how you define calendar (it can be User or any other object) or how your Event object looks like. Because all 'models' in this aplication are based on abstract class factory you can easly subclass them in very flexible manner.

h2. USAGE

I'm going to implement exmple app soon, but now you have to look into test.py if you want see any example.
